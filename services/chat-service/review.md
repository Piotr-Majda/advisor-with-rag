## Recommendations for MCP Protocol Integration

### 1. Tool Interface Enhancement

```python
class BaseTool(ABC):
    @property
    @abstractmethod
    def mcp_schema(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Return MCP-compatible schema"""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    async def execute(self, **kwargs) -> MCPResponse:
        """Execute tool and return MCP-formatted response"""
        pass

    def to_openai_function(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Convert MCP schema to OpenAI function"""
        return self._convert_mcp_to_openai(self.mcp_schema)
```

### 2. Agent Enhancement

1. **Dynamic Tool Registry**

```python
class ToolRegistry:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tools: Dict[str, BaseTool] = {}
        self.usage_stats: Dict[str, int] = {}

    async def register_tool(self, tool: BaseTool):
        self.tools[tool.name] = tool
        self.usage_stats[tool.name] = 0

    def get_tool_schemas(self) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        return [tool.mcp_schema for tool in self.tools.values()]
```

2. **Enhanced Agent Memory**

```python
class AgentMemory:
    def __init__(self, max_tokens: int = 4000):
        self.messages: List[Dict[str, str]] = []
        self.max_tokens = max_tokens
        self.token_count = 0

    async def add_message(self, message: Dict[str, str]):
        self.messages.append(message)
        self.token_count += self._count_tokens(message)
        await self._trim_if_needed()
```

3. **Tool Selection Logic**

```python
class ToolSelector:
    def __init__(self, registry: ToolRegistry):
        self.registry = registry

    async def select_tools(self, query: str) -> List[BaseTool]:
        """Select relevant tools based on query"""
        # Implement tool selection logic
        pass
```

        try:
            results = await self._search(query)
            return MCPResponse(
                status="success",
                data=results,
                metadata={
                    "query": query,
                    "result_count": len(results)
                }
            )
        except Exception as e:
            return MCPResponse(
                status="error",
                error=str(e)
            )

    @property
    def mcp_schema(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        return {
            "name": self.name,
            "description": self.description,
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "query": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "Search query"
                    }
                },
                "required": ["query"]
            }

# Agent Implementation Review

This document reviews the agent logic found in `services/chat-service/services/chat_service/agent/core.py` and `services/chat-service/services/chat_service/agent/chat_completion.py`.

## Overview

The current implementation provides a good foundation for an agent capable of using tools and maintaining conversation history. It separates concerns into distinct classes (`Agent`, `AgentConfig`, `AgentMemory`, `ToolManager`, `ChatCompletion`), which aligns well with SOLID principles. The use of an abstract `ChatCompletion` class is also a good practice for future flexibility.

## `agent/core.py` (`Agent` class)

### Strengths

- **Clear Structure:** The `Agent` class clearly defines its dependencies (`config`, `memory`, `tool_manager`, `chat_completion`).
- **Initialization:** Configuration is handled via `AgentConfig`, promoting explicit setup. Memory and tools are initialized appropriately.
- **Conversation Flow:** The `chat` method implements a standard agent loop: User Input -> LLM -> Tool Call (if needed) -> Tool Execution -> LLM -> Response.
- **Memory Management:** Messages (user, assistant, tool) are explicitly added to `AgentMemory` at the correct points in the flow. (Note: The actual implementation of `AgentMemory` is not reviewed here, but its usage pattern in `Agent` is sound).
- **Error Handling:** Specific OpenAI errors like `RateLimitError` are caught, along with a general `Exception` handler, which is crucial for robustness.

### Areas for Consideration & Improvement

1.  **`max_conversation_depth`:** This variable is defined in `__init__` but isn't currently used within the `chat` method's loop. If this is intended to prevent runaway loops _within a single user turn_ (e.g., the LLM repeatedly calling tools without reaching a final answer), you'll need to implement a counter within the `while True` loop and break or raise an error if the depth is exceeded.
2.  **Linter Error (`openai.InsufficientQuotaError`):** The linter flags `InsufficientQuotaError` as unknown. This might stem from using an older version of the `openai` library where this specific exception doesn't exist or has a different name (e.g., it might fall under `openai.APIError` or `openai.AuthenticationError`). You should verify the correct exception type for quota errors in the `openai` library version you're using. Update the `except` block accordingly.
3.  **Dependency Injection:** While `chat_completion` can be injected, consider making `AgentMemory` and `ToolManager` injectable as well. This improves testability, allowing you to easily provide mock implementations during unit testing without needing a full `AgentConfig`.
4.  **Yielding Responses:** The `chat` method yields `AgentResponse` objects of different types (`MESSAGE`, `TOOL_CALL`, `ERROR`, `DONE`). Ensure the consuming code correctly handles _all_ these types, especially `TOOL_CALL` if the consumer needs visibility into tool usage, or if intermediate `MESSAGE` chunks are being streamed to the user.

## `agent/chat_completion.py` (`OpenAIChatCompletion` class)

### Strengths

- **Abstraction:** Using the `ChatCompletion` ABC allows for potentially swapping out the OpenAI implementation later.
- **Streaming:** Correctly handles streaming responses (`stream=True`) for better perceived performance and real-time output.
- **Async:** Properly uses `async/await` for non-blocking I/O with the OpenAI API.

### Areas for Consideration & Improvement

1.  **Linter Errors (`create` Overload & `tools` Type):**
    - **`tools` Type:** The major issue here is the type mismatch for the `tools` parameter in `openai.chat.completions.create`. The API expects an `Iterable` of a specific type (like `ChatCompletionToolParam` from the `openai` library), not a simple `List[Dict[str, Any]]`. You need to ensure `BaseTool.to_openai_function()` (called in `Agent.__init__`) returns objects that conform to the type expected by the version of the `openai` library you are using. You might need to use Pydantic models provided by the `openai` library itself or ensure your dictionary structure exactly matches the required schema. Fixing this is crucial for the `create` call to work correctly.
    - **`create` Overload:** This error is likely directly related to the incorrect `tools` type. Once the `tools` type is corrected, this error should resolve.
2.  **Tool Call Reconstruction from Stream:** The logic to accumulate `arguments` for tool calls from delta chunks seems plausible but can be complex. Ensure it robustly handles cases like:
    - Multiple tool calls within a single assistant message.
    - JSON arguments being split across multiple chunks.
    - Potential errors in the argument JSON structure.
      Consider if the `openai` library offers any utilities or patterns for simplifying streamed tool call handling in your specific version.
3.  **Message Formatting:** Double-check the exact structure required for messages, especially the `tool` role message (`tool_call_id`, `name`), against the OpenAI API documentation for your version. Ensure `str()` conversions are appropriate for all content types.
4.  **Error Handling (`InsufficientQuotaError`):** Similar to `core.py`, the commented-out `InsufficientQuotaError` needs to be addressed. Use the correct exception type from your `openai` library version.

## Addressing High OpenAI Costs & Potential Causes

High costs often stem from more API calls than expected. Given your structure, consider these possibilities:

1.  **Inefficient Prompting:** Is the system prompt or are the user prompts leading the model to frequently require tool use, even when not strictly necessary?
2.  **Tool Feedback Loops:** Does a tool's output consistently cause the LLM to call the _same tool_ again without making progress? This could be due to ambiguous tool descriptions, the tool not providing enough information, or the LLM misinterpreting the results.
3.  **Error Handling Loops:** Could an error during tool execution lead to a state where the LLM tries the tool again repeatedly? Ensure tool errors are reported back clearly so the LLM can try a different approach or inform the user.
4.  **Conversation Length:** While you have `AgentMemory`, ensure it has a strategy (e.g., summarization, windowing) to keep the context sent to the API within reasonable limits for very long conversations. Sending excessive history increases token usage per call.

**Debugging Strategy:** Add detailed logging within the `Agent.chat` loop and `OpenAIChatCompletion.complete`. Log each message added to memory (user, assistant, tool call, tool response), the exact payload sent to OpenAI, and the response received. Analyzing this log for a costly interaction should reveal _why_ multiple calls are occurring.

## Rate Limiting Integration

Your plan to add a token bucket rate limiter is a good defensive strategy.

- **Integration Point:** The best place to integrate your Redis-based token bucket check is within `OpenAIChatCompletion.complete`, right _before_ the `await openai.chat.completions.create(...)` call.
- **Implementation Sketch:**
  - Inject or otherwise make your rate limiter service available to the `OpenAIChatCompletion` instance.
  - Before calling `create`, attempt to consume a token (or the estimated number of tokens) from the bucket.
  - If the bucket is empty/rate limit exceeded:
    - Decide on the behavior: Wait (e.g., `asyncio.sleep`) and retry, or raise a custom exception (e.g., `RateLimitExceededError`), or yield a specific `AgentResponse(type=ResponseType.ERROR, error="Rate limit hit")`. Raising an exception might be cleaner to handle further up the call stack.
  - If successful, proceed with the API call. Remember to handle potential errors during the rate limiter interaction itself.

## General Recommendations

- **Testing:** Invest heavily in testing.
  - **Unit Tests:** Test `ToolManager` execution logic, `AgentMemory` operations (if complex), and `OpenAIChatCompletion` (mocking the `openai` client and simulating stream responses/errors). Test the rate limiter logic thoroughly.
  - **Integration Tests:** Test the full `Agent.chat` flow with mock tools and a mock `ChatCompletion` to ensure the loop, memory, and response handling work correctly end-to-end.
- **Type Safety:** Resolve the linter errors, primarily the type issues with the OpenAI API calls. Use types provided by the library (`openai.types.chat...`) where possible.
- **Configuration:** Ensure sensitive details like API keys are not hardcoded but managed through configuration or environment variables.

## Next Steps

1.  Investigate and fix the linter errors, particularly the type mismatch for the `tools` parameter in `openai.chat.completions.create`.
2.  Verify and correct the exception types used for `InsufficientQuotaError`.
3.  Implement detailed logging to diagnose the cause of high API call frequency.
4.  Integrate your token bucket rate limiter into `OpenAIChatCompletion.complete`.
5.  Consider implementing the `max_conversation_depth` check if required.
6.  Review and enhance test coverage.

This review should give you a solid starting point for refining your agent implementation. Let me know when you'd like to discuss specific implementation details or move on to coding the changes!

# Review (Follow-up): Architecture, Streaming, and OpenAI Costs

This section addresses the broader architecture, Domain-Driven Design (DDD) aspects, chat streaming implementation, and provides further thoughts on the OpenAI cost concerns, aiming to guide decisions for stabilizing the service quickly.

## Microservice Architecture & DDD Perspective

### Microservice Viability

- **Bounded Context:** The `chat-service` appears to define a reasonable Bounded Context. Its core responsibility is managing conversational interactions powered by an AI agent using specific tools. This seems distinct enough to warrant being a separate microservice.
- **Responsibilities:** The service handles agent configuration, conversation state (memory), interaction with the LLM (OpenAI), and tool execution orchestration. This aligns well with the single responsibility principle for a microservice focused on "chat".
- **Interactions (Assumed):** It likely interacts with:
  - A frontend/client service (sending user input, receiving streamed/final responses).
  - Potentially other backend services via its Tools (e.g., a `document-service` for the `DocumentSearchTool`).
  - A configuration service or datastore (for agent configurations).
  - Redis (for your rate limiter).

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Hints

- **Ubiquitous Language:** Terms like `Agent`, `Tool`, `Memory`, `Message`, `ToolCall`, `AgentResponse` seem appropriate for the domain. Ensure this language is used consistently across the service and in discussions.
- **Entities/Value Objects:**
  - `Agent` could be considered an Aggregate Root, especially if a single agent instance handles a specific conversation or user session context.
  - `AgentConfig` seems like a Value Object defining the agent's static properties.
  - `Message`, `ToolCallData`, `ToolResponse`, `AgentResponse` are likely Value Objects representing immutable events or data packets within the conversation flow.
- **Repositories:** `AgentMemory` conceptually acts as a repository for conversation messages, though its current implementation details (persistence, retrieval logic) aren't fully visible in the reviewed files. For a robust microservice, consider how this memory is persisted (if needed beyond a single session) and potentially abstract it behind a formal Repository interface (e.g., `ConversationRepository`).
- **Services:**
  - The `Agent` class itself combines state (memory link) and behavior (chat loop), acting somewhat like a domain service orchestrating the interaction.
  - `ToolManager` is a domain service responsible for tool execution.
  - `OpenAIChatCompletion` is an infrastructure service abstracting the external LLM interaction.
- **Overall:** The structure shows good alignment with DDD principles like separation of concerns and modeling based on domain concepts. Making `AgentMemory` and `ToolManager` explicitly injectable, as mentioned previously, would further enhance adherence to DDD and improve testability.

## AI Agent Implementation & OpenAI Costs

Let's revisit the cost issue and agent design:

1.  **Critical Bug Fixes (Highest Priority):**
    - **`tools` Parameter Type:** The linter error regarding `openai.chat.completions.create` and the `tools` parameter type **must** be fixed. This is likely preventing successful API calls or causing unexpected behavior if the API call is malformed. Refer to the `openai` library documentation for the exact `ChatCompletionToolParam` structure required by your version. Your `BaseTool.to_openai_function` needs to return objects matching this structure.
    - **`InsufficientQuotaError`:** Identify the correct exception for quota errors in your `openai` library version and update the `except` blocks in both `core.py` and `chat_completion.py`. This ensures you handle this specific error state correctly.
2.  **Debugging High Call Frequency (After Bug Fixes):**
    - **Logging:** Implement detailed logging _before_ proceeding further. Log:
      - User input received by `Agent.chat`.
      - Messages being sent to `OpenAIChatCompletion.complete`.
      - Each `AgentResponse` yielded by `complete` (including tool calls and content chunks).
      - Tool name and arguments when `ToolManager.execute` is called.
      - Tool response content added back to memory.
      - Any errors encountered.
        This detailed trace is essential to understand _why_ loops might be occurring (e.g., LLM repeatedly calls tool A -> tool A returns X -> LLM calls tool A again).
    - **Tool Feedback Loop:** Analyze the logs. Does a tool's response directly lead the LLM to call the same tool again without apparent progress? This might require refining the tool's description (in `BaseTool`), the tool's execution logic (to provide clearer results), or the system prompt (to guide the LLM better).
    - **Maximum Depth/Turns:** Implement the `max_conversation_depth` counter within the `Agent.chat` loop to prevent infinite loops within a single user turn. Decide whether hitting the limit should result in an error message to the user or a specific "max depth reached" response.
3.  **Rate Limiting:** Integrating your Redis token bucket limiter in `OpenAIChatCompletion.complete` (before the API call) is the correct approach. Ensure the integration handles potential Redis connection errors gracefully and decides whether to wait/retry or fail fast when the limit is hit.

## Chat Streaming Implementation

You raised a valid point about the complexity of streaming.

- **True Server-Side Streaming (e.g., using `stream=True` with OpenAI):**
  - **Pros:** Provides the best user experience, showing responses as they are generated; reflects the actual LLM generation process; potentially faster time-to-first-token.
  - **Cons:** More complex to implement end-to-end. Requires:
    - Server: Handling async iteration over the OpenAI stream (`OpenAIChatCompletion` already does this), potentially transforming chunks, and sending them to the client using a suitable protocol.
    - Transport: A persistent or streaming connection like WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE). SSE is often simpler for server-to-client streaming.
    - Client: Receiving events/messages and appending content chunks to the UI dynamically. Handling message boundaries, tool calls (if streamed), and potential errors requires careful client-side logic.
    - Error Handling: Needs robust error handling across the stream.
- **UI Simulation (Generate Full Response, then "Type" in UI):**
  - **Pros:** Much simpler implementation. The backend generates the full response (waits for `ResponseType.DONE` or accumulates `MESSAGE` content), sends it back in one go (e.g., via a standard HTTP response), and the UI then simulates the typing effect.
  - **Cons:** Can feel less responsive if the full generation takes significant time. Doesn't accurately reflect the underlying process. User waits longer for the _first_ piece of content.

**Recommendation:**

- **For Pushing Today:** If true streaming feels too complex to implement _reliably_ right now, **simulating it in the UI is a pragmatic short-term solution.**
  1.  Modify `Agent.chat` to accumulate the `MESSAGE` content until `ResponseType.DONE` is received (or an error occurs).
  2.  Return the complete message content as a single `AgentResponse` (or part of a final response object).
  3.  Have the frontend receive this complete message and implement a JavaScript function to display it word-by-word or sentence-by-sentence to simulate streaming.
- **Long-Term:** Aim for true server-side streaming using **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**. It's generally well-suited for this kind of unidirectional flow from server to client and is often less complex than WebSockets. You've already done the hard part of handling the stream from OpenAI; the next step is relaying those chunks via SSE.

## Prioritized Actions for Today

1.  **Fix OpenAI API Call:** Correct the `tools` parameter type mismatch in `OpenAIChatCompletion.complete` based on your `openai` library version. This is blocking successful execution.
2.  **Fix Exception Handling:** Use the correct `InsufficientQuotaError` (or equivalent) exception type.
3.  **Integrate Rate Limiter:** Add the check to `OpenAIChatCompletion.complete` to prevent excessive costs. Decide on the behavior (wait/fail) when the limit is hit.
4.  **Implement Basic Logging:** Add essential logging points as described above to enable debugging if issues persist.
5.  **Decide on Streaming:** Choose either UI simulation (faster to implement now) or attempt true SSE (better UX long-term). If choosing UI simulation, adjust `Agent.chat` to return the full message.
6.  **(Optional but Recommended):** Implement the `max_conversation_depth` check in `Agent.chat` as a safety measure.

Focusing on these steps should help stabilize the core functionality and mitigate the cost issues, allowing you to push a more reliable version. Address the DDD refinements and more advanced features later.
